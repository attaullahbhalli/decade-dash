# 🎮 DecadeDash: A Journey Through Gaming History

**DecadeDash** is a retro-inspired web-based game that takes players on a time-traveling adventure through the history of video games — one iconic game per decade from the 1950s to the 2020s. The project was created for a hackathon with the theme **"Travelling Through Time"**.
